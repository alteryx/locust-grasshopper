"""Locust Custom Shapes.

Sometimes, a completely custom shaped load test is required that cannot be achieved by
simply setting or changing the user count and spawn rate. For example, one might want to
generate a load spike or ramp up and down at custom times. By using a one of these
classes which extend LoadTestShape, we have full control over the user count and spawn
rate at all times.
